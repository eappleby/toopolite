We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Company, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

<ol class="lower-alpha"><li><b>Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</b></li>
<ol class="lower-roman"><li><b>User Registration.</b> To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "<u>User ID</u>") and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).</li>

To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).

<li><b>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</b></li>
"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "<u>Tracking Technologies</u>") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.

We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", "Other Information Collected by Us" section below. These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site, such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("<u>Identifier</u>"). Your Identifier is automatically assigned to the Device you use to access the Site. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process.

By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies.

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<u>Third Party Advertising Service Providers</u>") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("<u>Targeting Services</u>"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

Although these Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.

<li><h2>Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities.</h2></li>
The Parent Company may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from the Parent Company, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Company and/or its Affiliates. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a>.

We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.

Users that register for the Parent Company's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Parent Company. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, the Parent Company or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b>

<ol class="lower-alpha"><li><b>Registration.</b> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for the Parent Company's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of the Parent Company depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</li>
<ol class="lower-roman"><li><b>Single Opt-in Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to the Parent Company will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to the Parent Company to send text messages to him or her. The Parent Company will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from the Parent Company or by sending a text message to the Parent Company that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</li>
<li><b>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to the Parent Company's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by the Parent Company) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. The Parent Company will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Parent Company to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of the Parent Company's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that the Parent Company may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while the Parent Company continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</li>
<li><b>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</b> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The Parent Company will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from the Parent Company to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of the Parent Company's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that the Parent Company may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while the Parent Company continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</li></ol>
<li><b>Termination of Wireless Services by User.</b> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from the Parent Company by the following procedure:</li>
A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by the Parent Company at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". MTV will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with the Parent Company. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of the Parent Company service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.

<li><b>Termination of Wireless Services by the Parent Company.</b> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Company may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. The Parent Company may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</li>
<li><b>Use of Information.</b> the Parent Company will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Company and Affiliates.</li></ol> 
<li><h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information.</h2></li>

We will disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.</li>
<li><b>Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.</b> The Site may also offer co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another company or our Parent Company or Affiliates ("<u>Co-Branded Partner</u>") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect the Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service, along with the Co-Branded partner's privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.</li>
<li><b>Disclosure to Operational Service Providers.</b> We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as "<u>operational service providers</u>". We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.</li>
<li><b>Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.</b> In addition to the above, we will make your Personal Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:</li></ol>
<ul><li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</li>
<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional Terms;</li>
<li>In connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate);</li>
<li>If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy;</li>
<li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Site, the Parent Company, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a> and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities and/or</li>

<li><h2>Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</h2></li>
Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by by emailing info@toopolite.com. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. If we elect to have a registration system, we will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.

Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.

If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.

<b>Children or Ineligible Teenagers.</b> If we, or our Parent Company or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("<u>Ineligible Teenagers</u>"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "<u>Parent</u>") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages by emailing us at unsubscribe@toopolite.com. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's email address to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("terms-of-service/"); ?>">Terms of Service Agreement</a> to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member.

<li><h2>Protection of Information.</h2></li>
While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.

<b>Phishing.</b> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. <b>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy@toopolite.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.
