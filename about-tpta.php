Too Polite To Ask is a collection of personal stories that help people better understand others.  Each story answers a compelling, yet rarely discussed question about the experiences and challenges that people face, such as <a href="<?php echo getUrl("what-it-feels-like-to-have-a-seizure/17"); ?>">"What does it feel like to have a seizure?"</a> or <a href="<?php echo getUrl("what-it-feels-like-to-be-bullied-in-school/8"); ?>">"What does it feel like to be bullied in school?"</a>.


<h2>Too Polite To Ask Book</h2>
The Too Polite To Ask book will be an anthology showcasing the very best answers submitted through the website.  Authors whose answers are chosen to be included in the book will be properly credited as the published author and will also receive one free copy of the publication (for more information, check out the <a href="<?php echo getUrl("answer-guidelines/"); ?>">Answer Guidelines</a>). 

The first book is projected to be available in its digital format by early 2012 in the Kindle and NOOKbook stores with subsequent titles that focus on specific categories (e.g. "Too Polite To Ask: Career Edition") to be available mid- to late- 2012.
