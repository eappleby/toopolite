Too Polite To Ask
=========

Too Polite To Ask is a collection of personal stories that help people better understand others.  Each story answers a compelling, yet rarely discussed question about the experiences and challenges that people face, such as "What does it feel like to have a seizure?" or "What does it feel like to be bullied in school?".
